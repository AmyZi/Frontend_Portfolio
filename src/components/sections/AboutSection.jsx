              I am an educator turned software developer, with four years of experience teaching as a public school teacher under Nigeria's Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). My journey into technology began unexpectedly at JSS Galadima, where I stepped in as a computer studies teacher. This role sparked my passion for technology and set me on a self-directed learning path in software development.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Leveraging my firsthand experience in Nigeria's education system, my future goal is to create customized software solutions that address the specific needs of Nigerian schools, which is also my area of research interest. I combine my educational expertise with growing technical skills to bridge the gap between technology and classroom needs.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              My unique perspective as both an educator and technology enthusiast positions me to develop practical, user-friendly applications that can enhance the Nigerian educational experience.
